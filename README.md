# Deep Convolutional GAN
A PyTorch implementation of DCGAN as described in the paper "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Alec Radford, Luke Metz, and Soumith Chintala. The dataset used is CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) which consists of over 200K images of celebrities with 40 binary attribute annotation.
