# Deep Convolutional GAN
A PyTorch implementation of DCGAN as described in the paper "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Alec Radford, Luke Metz, and Soumith Chintala. The dataset used consists of real and some GAN generated Human Faces and is available for public use on Kaggle.
